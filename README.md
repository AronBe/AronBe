Welcome! I'm **Aron** 👋, a **freelance Senior React Native developer** from **Prague**&nbsp;🇨🇿&nbsp; currently working at [STRV](https://strv.com), a top software development company. Feel free to visit my personal [site](https://aronberezkin.com) focused on practical React Native tutorials to build cross-platform mobile applications. My goal is to share what I learn and gather feedback to become a better developer and tutor.

I also enjoy discussing career change because my life journey first took me to **London**&nbsp;🇬🇧&nbsp; where I was working as a financial analyst for **Bloomberg**. But those are now just memories&nbsp;👋&nbsp; after I **switched career** at age of 30. You can read more about [how I become a web developer](https://aronberezkin.com/posts/how-i-left-a-financial-markets-career-for-web-development) and some more [React Native tips](https://aronberezkin.com/posts/what-i-learned-as-a-web-dev-on-my-first-react-native-project) when I started to shift focus on mobile development.
